# Auto Image Caption for Web Using Machine Learning
<h3> Chrome Extension That Uses Image Recognition to Fix Missing Alt Text</h3>

by Hayk Mikayelyan, Abi Mu√±oz 

<h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
Digital accessibility ensures that websites, web apps, and digital content can be used by people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight or cognitive abilities.
One way to promote digital accessibility is by using alt text (alternative text), which provides a text alternative to non-text content in web pages including images, media, etc.
Alt text can be challenging to audit, edit and/or update in existing websites. This Chrome extension will automate this process by using machine learning and image detection. Dense captioning (DenseCap) is the model used in this project. How does DenseCap work? A computer detects objects in images and describes them using text.
